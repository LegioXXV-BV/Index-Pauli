            <h1>About Myself</h1>
            <p>
                I have a lot of training and experience in IT over a few years. I studied and graduated from the Computer Technology program at SAIT.
                <br>This program specialized in JAVA Programming, Database design (SQL), and website development.  
                <br>Besides this SAIT program, I also studied for and passed both a CCNA and an A+ certification.     
            </p>
            <p>
                 I have also have various IT and non-IT jobs in my career. Some of these include working in creating websites for a non-profit agency, 
                 Technical Support for various companies, working in a warehouse driving a forklift, and working with the Post Office. 
            </p>
            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                I enjoy a lot of thinking / mental games.  Often I will be found solving a crossword puzzle or Sudoku.
                <br>If I am with friends, I like to play Chess or Cribbage.
                <br>I have been known to play a good game of Darts - it has a lot of thinking and math involved.      
            </p>

                I enjoy dogs, and I find smaller dogs are better. My little one can agree - if she could talk that is.

                I also play curling, and am an official licensed curling instructor.  Its harder than it looks, believe me. I enjoy it as it is a thinking game, and anyone can play.
                <br>You don't have to be tall, or very strong to play it.
