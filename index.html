                    It has been a few years since I have worked in IT.  I am hoping to get back into it - its a field that I have always enjoyed.
                    <br>I have made websites before - a few years ago. I made them in Notepad or VIM (not in this fancy editor).  Hopefully I will learn much more in this class.
                    <br>I studied Computer Programming at SAIT, where I learned HTML, JAVA and SQL. Also I learned and used Linux / Unix (RedHat at that time).
                    <br>That was some time ago as I remember using floppy disks at SAIT for assignments.

                    I have lived in Calgary my whole life.  That is rare nowadays, as the city has grown alot.
                    <br>Winter is my favoourite season - not that I enjoy minus 30 degree days, but I like the crisp days and snowy views.  Wearing sweaters is always a bonus.                
                    <br>I learned French in in primary and secondary schooling.  I am not completely fluent, but I have had many opportunities to speak it.
                </p>
                <p>I look forward to learning alot in this class and hope to have much success!</p>
